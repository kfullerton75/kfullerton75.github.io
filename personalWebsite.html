                    <p>
                        Hello world! I&#39m Kyle Fullerton, I'm a budding full-stack software engineer by trade and a gamer by choice.
                        I&#39ve found that gaming has given me different power ups that can relate to helping a company or team achieve their goals. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Puzzle games require me to utilize unconventional thinking to help me overcome obstacles.
                        The same is true for solving business problems. Not every problem is going to have a straightforward solution so having 
                        ability to think in an unorthodox manner can create elegant solutions.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Platformers I have to learn new mechanics each level while also dealing with a lot of failure, before accomplishing my goal
                        of beating the game. The same is true with software engineering. Continual updates to technology require a constant learning
                        mindset to stay up to date. While persistence is needed as figuring out a solution to a problem isn&#39t typically perfect in one go.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Tackling role-playing games is all about utilizing game mechanics to my advantage. Using certain abilities to make fights end 
                        quicker or items to ease the grind of leveling up my character. I too work to make my team&#39s life easier through designing and
                        implementing tools to automate or improve existing workflows.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        This leaves me with one question. How can I help your company or team level up?
                    </p>

                <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
                <h2 class="alignRight">Aug 2021 - Jan 2023</h2>
                <h4>
                    Collaborate with business analysts to turn business requirements into code features or
                    fixes for our java spring boot applications
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Investigate and document loan origination system behavior through sending api requests,
                    querying oracle database, and/or querying cassandra database
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Refactor ci/cd portal to utilize a micro service architecture in order to reduce code complexity
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Streamline routing logic of ci/cd portal to help with future development
                </h4>

                <p class="spanColumns">
                    Still with the front end team, I continued work on the CI/CD portal. Now that the release portion
                    of the portal had been ported there were still more kinks that needed to be worked out. 
                    The way routing was handled was a mess as it was handled with one gigantic, convoluted switch 
                    within one component that routed to different views based on the user's role, what type of 
                    they were trying to release, and what page they needed to get to. In order to simplify our code,
                    I worked on separating out portions of the code that could be their own standalone components into microservices.
                    This allowed our routing to only have to handle routing to the specific micro service needed and the rest would 
                    be handled by that component. 
                </p>

                <p class="spanColumns">
                    I transferred to a new team white still with the title of software engineer. 
                    I was back to working with the loan origination side of the business.
                    Here business analysts would provide a scenario in our loan origination system such as why are 
                    customers with a certain credit score receiving this interest rate. I was tasked with looking 
                    our system and documenting the behavior. The tasks required different areas of the system I would need to inspect.
                    Whether that be running an application through our spring boot application and showing what our Oracle database is
                    recording for the application or querying the Cassandra database to show behavior in another part of our system. 
                </p>

                <p class="spanColumns">
                    Other times I would do this research but then I would also fix problematic behavior in the system.
                    So Iâ€™d own my changes from end to end by designing a solution and getting the sign off from the business analyst,
                    implement and test my changes, get final sign off from the business analyst, and prepare my changes for release 
                    utilizing our Jenkins pipeline. 
                </p>
