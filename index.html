                        One video game that I love to play is Pokemon! So I thought I&#39d showcase my full stack skills through
                        creating an application based on an aspect of the Pokemon games, the Battle Frontier. I created a 
                        single page application where you can look up different Pokemon sets and what Pokemon sets particular
                        trainers have. Information is key when battling in Pokemon since your winning streak can come down to
                        knowing what particular moves or items your opponents Pokemon have. Currently, there isn&#39t a great way
                        to look up this information. Some websites do have the information but you have to constantly click 
                        between different pages to get what you&#39re looking for. Also, no website is going to have all the battle
                        facility Pokemon and trainers in one place. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned a lot through creating this project,as I created this whole thing myself, from planning out an
                        idea I had for a project to executing my vision. From the backend perspective, I created my own REST API
                        to manage the data through using the Django framework. I got a sense for how Django manages data through
                        models and serializers and how to set up the different end point functionality with views. From the frontend
                        perspective, I utilized React for creating the UI I designed. I learned how React utilizes components for 
                        building frontends as well as how the different hooks work, such as to manage the state of the application.
                        Lastly, I gained skills for deploying all pieces of this project together. I went with creating a build for 
                        the React frontend so I didn&#39t need two different servers but I had to manage Cross Origin Resource Sharing
                        in order for my frontend to get the info needed from the backend. I was comfortable with deploying my 
                        application on AWS since I already had knowledge of the platform. What was novel to me was configuring a 
                        web server for serving my application. I utilized gunicorn and nginx to serve my application as this was a 
                        fairly popular way to serve Django applications. This project was a labor of love that allowed me to not only
                        grow my skill set but also showcase what I can do as a software engineer.

                        Hello World! I&#39m Kyle Fullerton, a software engineer at your service! I&#39m currently seeking employment
                        with a focus on full stack developer roles but I am definitely open to working anywhere on the tech stack. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I&#39m gravitated towards working as a full stack developer since there&#39s always an opportunity to learn
                        a new skill or technology. I don&#39t have to fixate on one part of the tech stack and can move to improve
                        other areas of my skill set when I feel I&#39ve stagnated. With the ability to do it all, I can fit seamlessly
                        in any team environment or work independently through my knowledge on how to work on applications from the
                        design phase all the way through to a finished deployed product. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, singing, playing board games, watching sports, 
                        playing pickleball and ultimate frisbee, and watching musical theater. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to reach out for any possible software engineer roles. My contact info is listed below! 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Feb 2021 - Apr 2021</h3>
                    <h4>Teach a 10 week remote course with another instructor on basic html/css</h4>
                    <h4>Prepare curriculum for each week and create demos to help students visualize the lesson</h4>
                    <h4>Answer any questions from mentors or students on material</h4>
                    <h4>Adjust lesson plans/ exercises based on mentor feedback</h4>
                    <p>
                        I took on more responsibility with the coders program and taught the material.
                        Continued doing the remote basic css/html course.
                        Each week I'd partner with my co-instructor and go over the material we were teaching that week.
                        We would also prepare demos to help students visualize the concepts we were covering for the week.
                        Students were able to go through examples and then work towards creating a group website to present
                        at the end of the program to their friends and family.

                    <h3>Sep 2019 - Nov 2020 and Sep 2022 - Nov 2022</h3>
                    <h4>Help teach coding concepts through MIT app inventor and HTML/CSS</h4>
                    <h4>Answer questions students have on the material and show examples to check understanding</h4>
                    <h4>Guide students on process of creating their own app/website</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Coders program teaches underserved middle school students coding concepts.
                        How the concepts are taught varies on the program.
                        I volunteered for both the MIT App inventor course where students
                        learn mobile development with a block-based programming language
                        and another course that was all remote teaching basic css/html for web development.
                        As a mentor, I make sure students understand the material and answer any questions they may have.
                        Help guide students through practice examples for the week.
                        Also, students get to create their own app/website
                        for the last month of the course and show it off to their friends and family.
